# Timber Log Event JSON Schema

This is a formal definition of the [Timber](https://timber.io) log event JSON schema as defined
by the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) specification. All modifications to the schema will
be submitted through pull requests and tagged as releases.

We use this schema internally, in our API, to validate and transform incoming JSON messages.
It will not fall out of date.
