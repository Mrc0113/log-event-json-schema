# Timber Log Event JSON Schema

This is a formal definition of the [Timber](https://timber.io) log event JSON schema as defined
by the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) specification. All modifications to the schema will
be submitted through pull requests and tagged as releases.

You can use this schema as a complete representation of Timber's normalized log event schema.

As an aside, we use this schema internally for incoming log validation. As a result, it will
be maintained and up to date.
